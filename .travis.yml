#The first packages the library as a .ZIP file as would be uploaded to PyPI
#The second looks for all .ZIP files in the build (which here will just be the package we created from the first line)
#and pipes the filenames through to pip install installing the packages as would an end-user

#This way, every time we check code in to GitHub we can ensure that it:

#The packaging configuration is correct and generates a sensible package
#The packaging configuration has all the prerequisites listed correctly and can be pulled down from PyPI
#The packaged and installed library works
