FRED2 - An Immunoinformatics Framework for Python
-------------------------------------------------
Copyright 2014 by Benjamin Schuber,  Mathias Walzer, Philipp Brachvogel, Andras Szolek, Christopher Mohr, and Oliver Kohlbacher


FRED is a framework for T-cell epitope detection, and vaccine design. It  offers consistent, easy, and simultaneous access to well established prediction methods of computational immunology. FRED can handle polymorphic proteins and offers analysis tools to select, assemble, and design linker sequences for string-of-beads epitope-based vaccines. It is implemented in Python in a modular way and can easily be extended by user defined methods.
